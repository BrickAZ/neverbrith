# Isaac Localization Runtime

Use this skill when text or visual assets must change with the active game
language at runtime. It does not choose translations the user did not supply.

## First Move

Use `isaac-mod-context` to discover actual locale files, language codes,
runtime text callers, fonts, localized assets, and dependency declarations.
Then classify the route before adding code:

1. **Official API / current project table**: default for simple runtime text.
2. **Declared translation library**: use its registry only after the project
   confirms it is required and loaded.
3. **Optional library integration**: guard it in a compatibility module; core
   text and gameplay must still work without it.

Do not introduce CuerLib, EID, or another library merely because a reference
mod uses it. Do not assume `en`, `zh`, `jp`, `en_us`, or `zh_cn` are the
project's codes.

## Localization Surfaces

- **Runtime text**: popup text, HUD labels, menus, dialogue, or dynamic item
  names. Read `references/runtime-localization-architecture.md`.
- **Text fonts**: choose a discovered font per locale and define a usable
  fallback font.
- **Localized visual assets**: language-specific PNG/ANM2 text textures need
  a resolver and a fallback asset.
- **Description integrations**: EID, MCM, Encyclopedia, and wiki text remain
  optional surfaces. Use `isaac-compat-descriptions` for their guards and
  registration.
- **Static XML text**: use `isaac-compat-descriptions` for discovered XML
  locale synchronization rather than treating runtime tables as a replacement.

## Hard Rules

- Keep game language codes, internal translation-table codes, and optional
  integration language codes in an explicit mapping when they differ.
- Every runtime lookup must have a documented fallback: requested locale,
  default locale, then safe literal or existing project fallback.
- Keep language selection in a resolver or project-owned helper. Do not scatter
  `Options.Language` checks through unrelated item mechanics.
- A missing optional integration may skip only its own descriptions or UI;
  never disable the core item, entity, card, or challenge mechanic.
- A declared required library may be used directly only after the project
  context records where it is loaded and how missing-library failure is shown.
- Do not invent a translation, font, locale, or localized texture. Mark it
  `TBD` when the user or project has not supplied it.

## Handoff Prompt Template

```markdown
## Runtime Localization Spec

- Discovered game language codes:
- Internal table / integration code mapping:
- Default locale and fallback chain:
- Runtime text keys:
- Font per locale and fallback:
- Localized PNG/ANM2 assets and fallback:
- Dependency classification: official | project-owned | required | optional
- Optional integration guards:
- XML/EID/MCM surfaces delegated to:
- Missing translations or assets (TBD):
- Required static and in-game checks:
```

## Final Review

Before saying localization work is complete, report the observed language
mapping, every fallback path, dependency classification, touched surfaces, and
which language changes still need in-game verification.
