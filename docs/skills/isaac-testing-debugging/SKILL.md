# Isaac Testing And Debugging

Use this skill when the task is about proof, diagnosis, or verification.

The goal is to stop guessing. Isaac mod work needs a layered verification story: static checks, local behavior tests where possible, targeted logs or debug-console reproduction, then in-game checks for runtime-only surfaces.

## First Move

Before proposing a fix:

1. In an unfamiliar mod, use `isaac-mod-context` to discover the bootstrap files, test entrypoints, validation commands, and asset/XML roots. Do not assume `tests/`, `main.lua`, or a Lua test runner.
2. Classify the symptom using `references/symptom-triage.md`.
3. Decide which checks are static, scripted, or in-game.
4. Run `isaac-validators` for static surfaces when possible.
5. Discover the actual runner before declaring a local behavior test unavailable: inspect project scripts and documented tool paths, query the current shell, then query any environment-provided or bundled runtime. Record the exact executable path and version when found.
6. Read the closest existing project test before writing a new test; if none exists, choose the smallest available scripted or in-game reproduction.
7. If the issue is stateful, also use `isaac-state-lifecycle`.
8. If the intended mechanic itself is ambiguous, reconstruct its trigger/guard/result contract with `isaac-mechanic-contracts` before judging a callback as broken.

## Verification Layers

- **Static validation**: XML parse, missing assets, duplicate ids, language shape. Use `isaac-validators`.
- **Local behavior tests**: discovered Lua or project test files; use these for pure logic, callback helper behavior, state transitions, and localization scripts.
- **Targeted instrumentation**: temporary debug output, debug console steps, or narrow reproduction commands.
- **In-game verification**: visuals, render order, input handling, shader safety, entity collision, pickup behavior, challenge starts, save/reload behavior.

Read `references/verification-layers.md` before planning verification. Read `references/debug-report-template.md` before final reporting.

## Hard Rules

- Do not claim an Isaac runtime behavior is fixed only because code looks right.
- Do not run broad refactors while debugging a specific symptom.
- Do not patch before identifying the most likely failing surface.
- Do not leave temporary debug prints or forced spawn hooks in final code unless the user asked for a debug mode.
- When a test cannot run in the current environment, say exactly what was not run and provide the shortest in-game check.
- Do not conclude that Lua behavior tests are unavailable merely because `lua` is absent from `PATH`. Complete runner discovery first; do not install a runtime, alter global `PATH`, or change machine configuration unless the user explicitly asks.
- Separate “runner found but test failed”, “test was not run”, and “no compatible runner was found after discovery”.

## Static-Pass Runtime Failures

A clean validator run can still leave a callback unregistered, a valid entity
without update behavior, a wrong callback return, or a render/input path that
never occurs in game. For these cases, add a behavior test or focused in-game
reproduction. Static success proves structure, not event delivery or gameplay.

## Full-Entry Lua Load Check

When changing a large, monolithic Lua entry file, include a check that parses or loads the full discovered entry file with the closest compatible Lua runner. This catches compile-time failures such as exceeding Lua's local-variable limit, which XML/static validators and isolated helper tests cannot see.

- Prefer a lightweight Isaac stub that executes the real entry file when the game cannot be launched.
- Keep callback and asset stubs minimal; the goal is to prove the entry chunk loads and the changed handler is registered.
- Report separately if only an isolated helper was tested, or if no compatible Lua runner is available.

## Common Debug Routes

- Blank card or abnormal pickup: `isaac-cards-pockets` plus `isaac-validators`.
- Wrong, duplicated, blank, or lost reward: `isaac-rewards-pickups`, then check candidate validation, owner, repeat boundary, spawn/Morph fallback, and third-party preservation.
- Item does not trigger: item id lookup, callback registration, item ownership, active slot, charge/use return.
- Callback fires incorrectly or not at all: `isaac-callback-contracts`, registration line, handler existence, filter, callback-specific return policy, and a behavior test that invokes the registered handler.
- Visual missing: `isaac-anm2-visuals`, asset path, animation name, load owner, render/update path.
- Entity not behaving: `isaac-entities`, callback route, type/variant/subtype, `GetData()`, spawn/remove logic.
- Blank/meaningless entity or pickup: prove the spawn owner first, then check current-project registration, id/variant/subtype, ANM2/spritesheet/HUD chain, and invalid-target fallback. Do not test by globally deleting unknown entities.
- Challenge leaking: `isaac-challenges`, `Isaac.GetChallenge()` gate, state lifecycle cleanup.
- State persists or vanishes incorrectly: `isaac-state-lifecycle`, reset/save/reload plan.

## Final Review

Before saying debugging is complete, report:

- Symptom and suspected surface.
- Checks run and outputs summarized.
- Files inspected.
- Fix applied or recommended.
- Tests run.
- Manual in-game checks still required.
