# Isaac Item Economy

Use this skill when an item needs to enter the run economy, not merely exist in `items.xml`.

Read `../isaac-mod-context/references/design-authority.md` alongside this skill's economy-specific approval rules. The shared rule governs all design authority; this skill adds the pool and XML review surface.

The goal is to make pool placement, weight, quality, tags, depletion, and availability explicit while preserving the user's authority over balance decisions. A registered item with the wrong pool or weight can warp the run even when its Lua behavior is perfect.

## First Move

Before adding or reviewing itempools:

1. Read the item's Basic Item Spec and Mechanic Contract when the behavior affects power or consistency.
2. In an unfamiliar mod, use `isaac-mod-context` to discover the item and pool XML, all declared locales, and existing item-economy conventions. Do not assume `content/`, `itempools.xml`, or a fixed language set.
3. Read the current project's item XML, every discovered locale variant, and every discovered pool XML variant.
4. Read the closest current-project items occupying the proposed pool. When local precedent is insufficient, use this skill's pool and weight references without requiring another mod checkout.
5. Decide the player-facing acquisition story before choosing a numeric weight.
6. Mark every value the user already gave as `locked`. Mark every omitted balance field as `TBD` before offering advice.

Read the relevant reference:

- Pool placement and availability: `references/pool-placement.md`.
- Quality, weights, depletion, tags, and pool dilution: `references/weight-quality-tags.md`.
- Review table and static verification: `references/economy-review-checklist.md`.

## Hard Rules

- User-specified quality, pools, weights, tags, depletion, unlocks, and exclusions are locked decisions. Do not replace, reinterpret, or silently "balance" them.
- For an omitted field, provide one recommended proposal and, when the trade-off is meaningful, one alternative. Label each as `Suggestion`, include its reason, and keep it out of source XML until the user or an explicit upstream approval record accepts it.
- A `Suggestion` completes a review/handoff surface; it is not a claim that the value is objectively correct.
- Do not assign a pool, quality, tag, or weight merely because a similar item used one.
- Distinguish item power, reliability, rarity, and acquisition route. Quality does not replace pool placement; low weight does not repair a fundamentally wrong pool.
- State whether the item should deplete from a pool and why; treat `Weight`, `DecreaseBy`, and `RemoveOn` as one contract.
- Update the base item/pool XML and every discovered locale surface that owns the same data. The validator checks local name resolution, numeric fields, and structural parity; it cannot judge whether the economy feels fair.
- Do not put an item in every plausible pool to make it easy to encounter. Each extra pool dilutes that pool and changes the mod's identity.
- Keep tags coherent with actual mechanics and item category. Do not use tags as decorative metadata.
- If an unlock or challenge gate changes availability, write the gate separately from default pool placement.
- If the task chooses or replaces a concrete runtime reward/pickup, route that path to `isaac-rewards-pickups`; item economy does not authorize an unapproved reward subtype or quantity.

## Final Review

Before saying economy work is complete, report the review table with user decisions separated from suggestions, list the XML files changed, and distinguish structural validation from subjective balance review. Do not describe an unapproved suggestion as final balance.
